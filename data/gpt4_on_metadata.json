The inventory contains estimates of dry matter (DM) burned, which can be converted to emissions of various chemical species, such as CO2, CO, organic carbon (OC), and black carbon (BC), for the states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar. We develop a method that adjusts MODIS Fire Radiative Power (FRP) for: (1) additional small fires detected by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) at 375-m spatial resolution and (2) cloud/haze gaps in satellite observations using satellite observations; and (3) partial-field burns and (4) the diurnal cycle of fire activity using household survey responses. The associated code for the SAGE-IGP inventory is available from the SAGE-IGP GitHub repository",

    "description": "Abstract: The La Plata basin, located in southeast South America, has the deepest convection on earth with flash floods and thick convective clouds, often accompanied by hail and lightning in austral spring. Based on previous studies, deep convection is related to the strong low-level jet directed by the Andes. Here we quantify the role of the Andes on intense convection in the La Plata basin using the Community Earth System Model (CESM), focusing on the seasonal cycle. To examine the influence of the Andes on these severe storms, we run two model experiments with and without the Andes. Consistent with high-resolution satellite data, the modeling results show that precipitation is strongest in October, and severe October precipitation does not exist without the Andes. The annual mean precipitation decreases by 35%, extreme precipitation decreases by 49% in the No Andes experiment, and the mean and extreme precipitation occurs in January. We find that vertical wind shear is strongest in October for both runs, with the highest equator-to-pole temperature gradient, creating a favorable environment for atmospheric disturbances. The Andes create the low-level jet with surface southwestward moisture transport, and when the large-scale condition is best for perturbation, severe storms occur in the La Plata basin in spring. Without the southward moisture transport, October precipitation is weak in the run without the Andes. The results imply the importance of the Andes as a barrier to the tropical easterly flow, suggesting that a low-resolution model that underestimates the elevation of the Andes cannot properly simulate the low-level jet, accompanying moisture flux, and precipitation extremes.",

    "description": "This is a preliminary database of loading-induced stress changes on the Earth from 2000 to 2017 in a global scale and at various depths. Five loading forces that would generate stress changes on the Earth are considered: hydrological loading, atmospheric pressure, ocean water (including tides and non-tidal variation), solid Earth tides and postglacial rebound (PGR). The loading forces are quantified using the terrestrial water storage (TWS) inferred from GRACE solutions, the ECMWF surface atmospheric pressure model, the TPXO 7.2 ocean tide solutions, CMEMS sea level anomaly model, tidal forces computed by the SPOTL package, and the ICE-5G glacial history model, respectively. The loading masses are assumed to distribute within a thin layer (relative to the Earth\u2019s radius) on the Earth\u2019s surface, and are used to calculate the Earth\u2019s stress responses through a spherical spectral method. Based on the different time scales of the loading forces, an incompressible viscoelastic Earth model is adopted for PGR and a compressible elastic one is adopted for the other forces. The stress database could motivate more comprehensive studies to seek clearer physical insights on triggering mechanisms of various tectonic events, such as earthquake, non-volcano tremor, slow slip event and volcano. The physical framework we have established in the stress calculation could be a useful tool for updating and improving the stress estimates in the future and could facilitate more comprehensive studies of elastic/viscoelastic parameters and physical states of the Earth\u2019s interior at various time scales and length scales. Please refer to Lu et al. (2018, JGR) for the detailed methods and parameters used to calculate the loading-induced stress. Currently, the stress results are output on 1x1 degree grids, and at depths of 0 km, 19 km, 50 km, and 100 km.",

    "description": "Replication data for \"Regional mixed layer depth as a climate diagnostic and emergent constraint.\" Abstract: The global ocean modulates Earth\u2019s warming in response to forcing. Most research has nevertheless ignored using ocean processes as a means to improve warming projections in general circulation models (GCMs). We show that regional mixed layer depth (MLD) strongly constrains climate sensitivity through its relation to ocean heat uptake. We correlate the parameters of two-layer energy balance models (EBMs) to average pre-forcing MLD in the north, tropical and south ocean for a 25-member CMIP6 ensemble. Using observations from the Argo float network, we then constrain the 66% range of equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) for the ensemble from 4.51 (3.13--5.71)\u00b0C, to 4.66 (3.88--5.43)\u00b0C -- a 40% reduction in the span of the uncertainty range -- and demonstrate significant correlations between MLD and other EBM parameters. This result indicates new explanations of ensemble spread, a new use for Argo measurements, and path to improving GCMs.",

The CSD slope is calculated from emote sensing reflectance at 8 MODIS bands (412, 443, 469, 488, 531, 547, 555, and 678 nm). A large CSD slope indicates a large proportion of smaller phytoplankton, whereas a small CSD slope suggests that larger phytoplankton dominate. To avoid unrealistic values of the CSD slope, we defined the upper and lower limits of the CSD slope as 3.0 and 0.0, respectively.",

As such, we provide scaling factors which can be used to correct these low biases, which can be applied across event extremity. The scaling factors can be used as follows: (1) Utilize the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution to estimate seasonal return values for a 1/16 grid cell of interest using a particular LOCA solution or the L15 data set. Here, we use three-month seasons (DJF, MAM, JJA, and SON). (2) Select the scaling factor corresponding to the grid cell and season of interest. (3) An observationally \"bias-corrected\" return value estimate is equal to the L15 or LOCA return value multiplied times the scaling factor.",

    "description": "Abstract: Current coupled global climate models have biases in their simulations of the tropical Pacific mean state conditions as well as the El Ni\\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. Specifically, in the Community Earth System Model (CESM version 1.2.2), the tropical Pacific mean state has overly weak sea surface temperature (SST) gradients in both the zonal and meridional directions, ENSO cycles are too frequent and too regular, and El Ni\\~no and La Ni\\~na events are too symmetrical. In our previous study with a slab ocean model, we showed that a higher elevation of the Andes can improve the tropical Pacific mean state simulation by adjusting the atmospheric circulation and increasing the east-west and north-south SST gradient. Motivated by the link between the mean tropical Pacific climate and ENSO variations shown in previous studies, we explored the influence of the Andes on the simulation of ENSO using the Community Earth System Model (CESM) version 1.2.2 under full atmosphere-ocean coupling. In addition to improving the simulated tropical Pacific mean state by increasing the strength of the surface easterly and cross-equatorial southerly wind, the Higher Andes experiment decreases the ENSO amplitude, increases the phase asymmetry, and makes the ENSO events less regular, resulting in a simulated ENSO that is more consistent with observations. The changes in the mean state and ENSO are connected by mean wind effects on the dynamic feedbacks. Our overall result is that increasing the height of the Andes improves the biases in the mean state and ENSO statistics in the tropical Pacific.",
