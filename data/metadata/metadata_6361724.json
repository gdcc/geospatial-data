Time span: 1901-2010 Indices: Rx1day (annual maximum 1-day precipitation), Rx5day (annual maximum 5-day precipitation) For analysis of long-term change, stations have been selected by record length. In particular, only stations with at least 30, 50, or 70 years of records during 1901-2010 were selected. For more details please see Zhang and Zhou (2019).",
