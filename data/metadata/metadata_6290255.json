The regional box configuration can be found at https://github.com/MITgcm-contrib/llc_hires/tree/master/llc_4320/regions/Box56. More descriptions of the simulation numerics are in the supplementary information of the paper. The analysis routines for the vertical wavenumber spectra for kinetic energy, shear and strain are also included here. The codes are written in MATLAB language and they work for MATLAB 2022a version. The MP data have been taken from Alford et al 2007 and Savage et al 2017 and uploaded here. The MP data can also be downloaded from https://github.com/annasavage/McLane_profiler_data",
